Hiiii~! I'm **Yme** and I make Super Paper Mario mods. My main project at the moment is **Lunatic Pit** *(formerly known as the Pit Randomizer)*.

If I'm not working on Lunatic Pit, I'm working, watching anime, or doing some other SPM reverse engineering project on Ghidra.

If you'd like to submit a bug report, feature request, or talk about anything else related to my projects, please join the [Flipside Tower Discord server](https://discord.gg/ndrxwcyCum), the definitive hub for Super Paper Mario modding~

Consider throwing me a few bucks on my [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/tarttapple) if you enjoy my work! ;P I work full-time and I'm paying off some hefty student loans, so everything helps! Thank you!!!!
