Hiiii~! I'm **Yme** and I make Super Paper Mario mods. My main project at the moment is **Lunatic Pit** *(formerly known as the Pit Randomizer)*.

If I'm not working on Lunatic Pit, I'm working, watching anime, or doing some other SPM reverse engineering project on Ghidra.

If you'd like to discuss my mods, be it a bug report, feature request, or anything else, please join the [Flipside Tower Discord server](https://discord.gg/ndrxwcyCum), the definitive hub for Super Paper Mario modding~
